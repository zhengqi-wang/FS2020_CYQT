# FS2020_CYQT
MSFS2020 Airport addon/mod for Thunder Bay International Airport (ICAO: CYQT/IATA: YQT), Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada

Developed from the default scenery and the official SDK.

Version 0.1.0

Updates from the default airport:

Taxiway definitions are corrected.
Taxiway markings are corrected corresponsively.
Taxiway edge light on the intersect of A and B is eliminated.
Gate and jetway position corrected for the main 3 positions in front of the terminal. 
VASI of all runways corrected to PAPI 4 to match the real situations.
Add yellow "x" on the taxiway H west of G to match the real situation.

Known Unsolved Issues: 

Gate numbers are not cleared to be right or wrong. I follow the number on Google Map.
Some taxiway markings are FAA style and the correcting to ICAO style is in process.
Runway 07/25 too bright under some settings.

Future Plan:

Update the terminal building.
Update the buildings of Tower, Ornge, Lavero Aviation, Confederation Colledge Center of Excellence
Update the buildings of Apron 3, 4, 5, 6.
