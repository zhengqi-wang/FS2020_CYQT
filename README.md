# FS2020_CYQT
MSFS2020 Airport addon/mod for Thunder Bay International Airport (ICAO: CYQT/IATA: YQT), Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada

Developed from the default scenery and the official SDK.

Version 0.1.0

Updates from the default airport:

1. Taxiway definitions are corrected.  
2. Taxiway markings are corrected corresponsively.  
3. Taxiway edge light on the intersect of A and B is eliminated.  
4. Gate and jetway position corrected for the main 3 positions in front of the terminal.   
5. VASI of all runways corrected to PAPI 4 to match the real situations.  
6. Add yellow "x" on the taxiway H west of G to match the real situation.  

Known Unsolved Issues: 

1. Gate numbers are not cleared to be right or wrong. I follow the number on Google Map.  
2. Some taxiway markings are FAA style and the correcting to ICAO style is in process.  
3. Runway 07/25 too bright under some settings.  

Future Plan:

1. Update the terminal building.  
2. Update the buildings of Tower, Ornge, Lavero Aviation, Confederation Colledge Center of Excellence.  
3. Update the buildings of Apron 3, 4, 5, 6.
